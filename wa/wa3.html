        <h1 id="History">History</h1>
        <p>The majors originally consisted of two British tournaments, 
            The Open Championship and The Amateur Championship, and two American tournaments, the U.S. Open and the U.S. Amateur. With the introduction 
            of the Mkasters Tournament in 1934, and the rise of professional golf in the late 1940s and 1950s, the term "major championships" eventually 
            came to describe the Masters, the U.S. Open, the Open Championship, and the PGA Championship. It is difficult to determine when the definition 
            changed to include the current four tournaments, although many trace it to Arnold Palmer's 1960 season. After winning the Masters and the U.S. 
            Open to start the season, he remarked that if he could win the Open Championship and PGA Championship to finish the season, he would complete 
            "a grand slam of his own" to rival Bobby Jones's 1930 feat. Until that time, many U.S. players such as Byron Nelson also considered the Western
             Open and the North and South Open as two of golf's "majors",[7] and the British PGA Matchplay Championship was as important to British and 
             Commonwealth professionals as the PGA Championship was to Americans.
            During the 1950s, the short-lived World Championship of Golf was viewed as a "major" by its competitors, as its first prize was worth almost 
            ten times any other event in the game, and it was the first event whose finale was televised live on U.S. television. The oldest of the majors
             is The Open Championship, commonly referred to as the "British Open" outside the United Kingdom. Dominated by American champions in the 1920s
              and 1930s, the comparative explosion in the riches available on the U.S. Tour from the 1940s onwards meant that the lengthy overseas trip 
              needed to qualify and compete in the event became increasingly prohibitive for the leading American professionals. Their regular participation 
              dwindled after the war years. Ben Hogan entered just once in 1953 and won, but never returned. Sam Snead won in 1946 but lost money on the trip 
              (first prize was $600) and did not return until 1962. Golf writer Dan Jenkins, who was often seen as the world authority on majors since he had 
              attended more (200+) than anyone else, once noted that "the pros didn't talk much about majors back then. I think it was Herbert Warren Wind who 
              starting using the term. He said golfers had to be judged by the major tournaments they won, but it's not like there was any set number of major 
              tournaments."

        <h2 id="importance">Importance</h2>
        <p>Alongside the biennial Ryder Cup team competition, the majors are golf's most important events. Elite players from all over the world participate 
            in them, and the reputations of the greatest players in golf history are largely based on the number and variety of major championship victories
             they accumulate. The top prizes are not actually the largest in golf, being surpassed by The Players Championship, three of the four World Golf 
             Championships events (the HSBC Champions, promoted to WGC status in 2009, has a top prize comparable to that of the majors), and some other invitational
              events. However, winning a major boosts a player's career far more than winning any other tournament. If he is already a leading player, he will probably
               receive large bonuses from his sponsors and may be able to negotiate better contracts. If he is an unknown, he will immediately be signed up. Perhaps
                more importantly, he will receive an exemption from the need to annually re-qualify for a tour card on his home tour, thus giving a tournament golfer
                 some security in an unstable profession. Currently, both the PGA Tour and European Tour give a five-year exemption to all major winners and they 
                 receive the highest priority in those rankings. Independent organizations, and not the PGA Tour, operate each of the majors; The Players Championship is 
                 the tour's most important event.[12] Three of the four majors take place in the United States. The Masters is played at the same course, Augusta National
                  Golf Club, every year, while the other three rotate courses (the Open Championship, however, is always played on a links course). Each of the majors has 
                  a distinct history, and they are run by four separate golf organizations, but their special status is recognized worldwide. Major championship winners 
                  receive the maximum possible allocation of 100 points from the Official World Golf Ranking, which is endorsed by all of the main tours, and major championship 
                  prize money is official on the three richest regular (i.e. under-50) golf tours, the PGA Tour, European Tour and Japan Golf Tour.

        <p>The Masters Tournament (sometimes referred to as the U.S. Masters), the season's first major championship, is the only major that is played at the 
            same course every year (Augusta National Golf Club), being the invitational tournament of that club. The Masters invites the smallest field of the
             majors, generally under 100 players (although, like all the majors, it now ensures entry for all golfers among the world's top 50 before the event),
              and is the only one of the four majors that does not use "alternates" to replace qualified players who do not enter the event (usually due to injury).
               Former champions have a lifetime invitation to compete, and also included in the field are the current champions of the major amateur championships, 
               and most of the previous year's PGA Tour winners (although winners of "alternate" events held opposite a high-profile tournament do not receive automatic 
               invitations). The traditions of Augusta during Tournament week, such as the Champion's Dinner, Par 3 Contest, and awarding of a green jacket to the champion, 
               create a distinctive character for the tournament, as does the course itself, with its lack of primary rough but severely undulating fairways and greens, 
               traditional pin placements, and punitive use of ponds and creeks on several key holes on the back nine. The PGA Championship (sometimes referred to as the U.S. PGA),
                which from 2019 is the year's second major, is traditionally played at a parkland club in the United States, and the courses chosen tend to be as difficult as those 
                chosen for the U.S. Open, with several, such as Baltusrol Golf Club, Medinah Country Club, Oakland Hills Country Club, Oak Hill Country Club, and Winged Foot Golf
                 Club, having hosted both. The PGA generally does not set up the course to be as difficult as the USGA does. The PGA of America enters into a profit-sharing 
                 agreement with the host club. (An exception was in 2014, when the tournament was held at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky, a club that the PGA of 
                 America fully owned at the time.) As with The Masters, previous winners of the PGA Championship have a lifetime invitation to compete. As well as inviting 
                 recent champions of the other three professional majors and leading players from the world rankings, the PGA Championship field is completed by qualifiers 
                 held among members of the PGA of America, the organization of club and teaching professionals that are separate from the members of the PGA Tour. The PGA 
                 Championship is also the only one of the four majors to invite all winners of PGA Tour events in the year preceding the tournament, as well as inviting 20
                  club professionals who are non-tour regulars. Amateur golfers do not normally play on the PGA Tour, and could only qualify by winning one of the other three 
                  majors, winning a PGA Tour event while playing under a sponsor's exemption, or having a high world ranking. When the PGA Championship was held in August, 
                  it was frequently affected by the high heat and humidity that characterize the summer climate of much of the U.S., which often set it apart as a challenge 
                  from (in particular) the Open Championship, an event often played in cooler and rainy weather. With the 2019 move to a May date, heat and humidity are less 
                  likely to have major effects on the competition. The third major, the U.S. Open, is notorious for being played on difficult courses that have tight fairways, 
                  challenging greens, demanding pin positions and thick and high rough, placing a great premium on accuracy, especially with driving and approach play. Additionally,
                   while most regular tour events are played on courses with par 72, the U.S. Open has almost never been held on a par-72 course in recent decades; the 2017 event 
                   was the first since 1992 to be played at par 72.[15] During this time, the tournament course has occasionally been played to a par of 71 but most commonly par 70. 
                   The U.S. Open is rarely won with a score much under par. The event is the championship of the United States Golf Association, and in having a very strict exempt 
                   qualifiers list – made up of recent major champions, professionals currently ranked high in the world rankings or on the previous year's money lists around the world, 
                   and leading amateurs from recent USGA events – about half of the 156-person field still enters the tournament through two rounds of open qualification events, mostly 
                   held in the U.S. but also in Europe and Japan. The U.S. Open has no barrier to entry for either women or junior players, as long as they are a professional or meet
                    amateur handicap requirements. As of 2022, however, no female golfer has yet qualified for the U.S. Open, although in 2006 Michelle Wie made it to the second 
                    qualifying stage. While the U.S. Open employed an 18-hole playoff for many years if players were tied after four rounds, the USGA announced that beginning in 
                    2018 all of its future championships would implement a two-hole aggregate playoff format. A sudden-death playoff would follow if the players were still tied 
                    after the two playoff holes.[16] (This change also brought the U.S. Open more in line with both the Open and PGA Championships, which use four- and three-hole
                     aggregate playoffs respectively, followed by sudden death if necessary, and most regular events as well as the Masters only have simple sudden-death playoffs.)
                      The Sunday of the Championship has also in recent years fallen on Father's Day (at least as recognized in the US and the UK) which has lent added poignancy to
                       winners' speeches. The year's final major, The Open Championship (sometimes referred to as the British Open), is organized by The R&A, an offshoot of The Royal
                        and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, and is typically played on a links-style course in the United Kingdom (primarily Scotland or England). It carries the 
                        prestige of being the oldest professional golf tournament currently in existence and the original "Open" championship (although the very first event was held
                         only for British professionals). It is respected for maintaining the tradition of links play that dates back to the very invention of the game in Scotland. 
                         Links courses are generally typified as coastal, flat and often very windswept, with the fairways cut through dune grass and gorse bushes that make up the 
                         "rough", and have deep bunkers. The course is generally not "doctored" to make it more difficult, effectively making the variable weather the main external
                          influence on the field's score.[17] In fact, the greens at Open venues tend to be set up to play more slowly than those of normal tour stops. In windy 
                          conditions, a course with fast greens can become unplayable because the wind could affect balls at rest; the third round of the 2015 Open saw many delays 
                          for this very reason.[18] As well as exempting from qualifying recent professional major and amateur champions, all former Open Championship winners under
                           age 60, and leading players from the world rankings, the R&A ensures that leading golfers from around the globe are given the chance to enter by holding 
                           qualifying events on all continents, as well as holding final qualifying events around the UK in the weeks before the main tournament. The champion receives 
                           (and has his name inscribed on the base of) the famous Claret Jug, a trophy that dates back to 1872 (champions from 1860 until 1871 received instead a 
                           championship belt, much like a champion professional boxer's belt nowadays) and the engraving of the champions' name on the trophy before them receiving it
                            is, in itself, one of the traditions of the closing ceremony of the championship, as is the award of the silver medal to the leading amateur player to have
                             made the cut to play the last 36 holes.</p>
